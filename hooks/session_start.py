"""Restore learning context when a supported coding agent starts a session.

The agent sends a JSON event on stdin. For a project with active learning notes,
we print JSON instructions telling the agent which files to read. Otherwise we stay
silent. This hook does not teach, write notes, or parse conversation transcripts.
The events that trigger it are configured in the platform hook manifests.
